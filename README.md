# UniHack Setup

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Visual Studio** (latest update via Visual Studio Installer, required for .NET 9)
- **.NET 9 SDK** ([Download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download))
- **Node.js** ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Vue.js extension for VS Code** (should prompt in the bottom left when opening a `.vue` file) - Do this after cloning the repo

## Setup Steps
1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Navigate to the solution directory** (consider renaming `my-vue-app` ), then open in termal and do:
   ```sh
   cd my-vue-app
   ```

3. **Install npm**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Optional Tools
- **SQLite Toolbox**: Install this if you want to view the database like in SSMS.

## Troubleshooting
- **Port Conflicts**: If the default ports are in use on your machine, we can adjust them as needed (We should sort this issue out as a team if we get it).
